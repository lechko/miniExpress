1) what was hard?
- Dealing with the asynchrounous model
- Implementation of HTTP Pipelining (request are received and handled in asynchrounous matter, 
	however responses must be in the same order as requests).
- Modeling the system so it will be clear (hopefully).

2) what was fun? (do we really need to say? ;)
- Taking a look at the Express code, and get a view of a real good design.
- Running the exercise on our Ex2 and seeing that our HTTP server works.

3) efficiency
- All was done in asynchronous mode - all I/O calls, and Middlewares calls (using Process.nextTick()).
- Taking some functions out of the different objects we defined so that they won't be copied with each instance of the object.
