scoping:
on the cotrary of Java, which has block based scopes, javascript has two major scopes - the function scope and the global scope.
inside these scopes, all declerations are copied two the head of the function, this is called hoisting.


dynamic types:
variable types are determined dinamicaly at run time.
functions can just get arguments, without declaring their types.
this helps the programmer focus on whats really matters - the algorithm and the design of the program.
